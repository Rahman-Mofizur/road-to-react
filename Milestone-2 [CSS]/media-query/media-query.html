          <h3>Lisa BlackPink</h3>
          <p>
            Lisa from BLACKPINK is on a roll. Not content with a hit solo album,
            endorsements for various brands in several countries and 66 million
            Instagram followers, the fashionista now has a make-up collection to
            call her own. Already a global brand ambassador for M·A·C, Lisa has
            launched her debut make-up collection, M·A·C x L. This is a
            partnership between a brand and an artiste with so much in common –
            creative trendsetters with global relevance who break boundaries
            with their artistry and self-expression. And Lisa is definitely
            bursting with pride over this new collaboration.

          <h3>Tzuyu</h3>
          <p>
            In 2012, Tzuyu was discovered by talent scouts at the MUSE
            Performing Arts Workshop in Tainan and moved to South Korea in
            November of that year to start her training. In 2016, she passed an
            exam at Tainan Municipal Fusing Junior High School to certify her
            middle school education. She attended high school at Hanlim Multi
            Art School in South Korea and graduated in February 2019. In 2015,
            Tzuyu participated in the South Korean reality television show
            “Sixteen,” hosted by JYP Entertainment and co-produced by Mnet. As
            one of nine successful participants, she went on to join the newly
            formed girl group TWICE. Unlike the other winners of “Sixteen,”
            Tzuyu was selected based on audience voting.

        <p>
          The limited-edition collection is all about Lisa making her fans feel
          as confident and empowered as she does. And it’s made for all ages,
          races and genders. It’s a labour of love by both Lisa and the M·A·C
          team. “The team and I put so much energy and attention to detail into
          this collection; I channelled the same passion, joy and creativity I
          give to making music into creating this exclusive collection for my
          fans,” Lisa shares.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’m so excited to reveal to you one of my biggest projects so far as
          Global Ambassador of M·A·C Cosmetics: my very own full-face make-up
          collection!” she says in a press release. “I curated the collection
          myself and designed every piece after things I absolutely love. Every
          shade, product, name and even the packaging design represents
          something very special to me.” Lisa also revealed she’s “so proud of
          what we’ve created together” and she loves that the make-up brand
          “gave me the creative freedom to bring my own make-up line-up to life!
          This is my dream come true”. Regan Rabanal, M·A·C Education Director,
          APAC, summarises the collection as one that “has everything to make
          you feel confident and beautiful for your epic holiday moment. Now
          it’s easier than ever to get Lisa’s look with shades that go from day
          to play!” And who doesn’t want to emulate Lisa’s iconic looks?
